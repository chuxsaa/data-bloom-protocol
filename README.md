# DataBloom Storage Protocol

DataBloom is a decentralized data reservation protocol built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. It enables parties to create, manage, and finalize time-bound storage commitments with verifiable guarantees and programmable dispute resolution mechanisms.

 Decentralized data reservation and allocation system built on Clarity smart contracts. Enables time-bound, cryptographically-verifiable data commitments with flexible lifecycle operations and multi-party dispute resolution.

## 📦 Features

- ⏳ **Time-bound Reservations**: Reserve data with expiration logic tied to block height.
- 👥 **Multi-party Role Control**: Originators, beneficiaries, verifiers, and supervisors.
- 🔐 **Cryptographic Verification**: Support for proof-based verification of data actions.
- 🛠️ **Dispute Resolution**: Mediation mechanisms for resolving conflicts in a decentralized manner.
- 🚫 **Fail-safe Mechanisms**: Revert, expire, and suspend reservations securely.

## 🧠 Concepts

### Reservation Lifecycle

1. **Create Reservation**
2. **Extend / Modify** (Optional)
3. **Finalize Transfer** or **Revert**
4. **Challenge or Mediate** (if dispute)
5. **Reclaim or Expire**
